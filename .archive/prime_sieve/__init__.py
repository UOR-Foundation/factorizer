Prime Sieve: Pure Combinatorial Factorization Engine

A revolutionary factorization approach based on the UOR/Prime axioms.
The Prime Sieve operates through multi-dimensional mathematical sieving
to reveal factors at the intersection of prime coordinates, golden flows,
and spectral coherence fields.

Key Features:
- Arbitrary bit-length support with no upper limit
- Pure combinatorial approach (no randomization or fallbacks)
- Multi-dimensional sieving through 5 axiom spaces
- Self-referential meta-learning and adaptation
- Deterministic factor discovery

Usage:
    from prime_sieve import PrimeSieve
    
    sieve = PrimeSieve()
    p, q = sieve.factor(n)
