# The Pattern Solver

A clean implementation of **The Pattern** - a universal principle for factorization through recognition, formalization, and execution.

## Core Philosophy

The Pattern represents the fundamental insight that any mathematical system can be:

1. **Recognized** - Its essential signature extracted
2. **Formalized** - Expressed in universal mathematical language  
3. **Executed** - Operated upon to reveal hidden structure

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`pattern.py`** - The Pattern implementation with three stages
- **`universal_basis.py`** - Mathematical foundation using universal constants (φ, π, e, 1)
- **`factor_decoder.py`** - Decoding factors from universal signatures
- **`advanced_pattern.py`** - Advanced techniques including Lie algebras and adelic analysis

### Key Concepts

1. **Universal Signature**: Every number has a unique representation in terms of universal constants
2. **Resonance Field**: A field encoding the number's harmonic structure
3. **Pattern Matrix**: Encodes relationships between universal components
4. **Factor Encoding**: Universal representation of factor relationships

## Usage

```python
from pattern_solver import Pattern, UniversalBasis, FactorDecoder

# Initialize components
pattern = Pattern()
basis = UniversalBasis()
decoder = FactorDecoder(basis)

# Connect components
pattern.universal_basis = basis
pattern.decoder = decoder

# Factor a number
n = 143  # 11 × 13

# Stage 1: Recognition
signature = pattern.recognize(n)

# Stage 2: Formalization  
formalization = pattern.formalize(signature)

# Stage 3: Execution
p, q = pattern.execute(formalization)

print(f"{n} = {p} × {q}")
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Universal Basis

The Pattern operates in a 4-dimensional space defined by:
- **φ** (phi) - The golden ratio, representing optimal growth
- **π** (pi) - Circular constant, representing periodicity
- **e** - Natural base, representing exponential relationships
- **1** (unity) - The identity, representing wholeness

### Recognition Process

1. **φ-component**: Logarithmic relationship to golden ratio
2. **π-component**: Position in circular/periodic space
3. **e-component**: Exponential growth characteristics
4. **Unity phase**: Normalized projection

### Formalization Process

Converts the signature into:
- Universal coordinates
- Harmonic series expansion
- Resonance peak analysis
- Pattern matrix construction
- Factor relationship encoding

### Execution Process

Multiple decoding strategies:
1. **Resonance Decoding**: Peaks in resonance field indicate factors
2. **Eigenvalue Extraction**: Pattern matrix eigenvalues encode factors
3. **Harmonic Intersection**: Harmonic relationships reveal structure
4. **Phase Analysis**: Phase relationships encode factor differences
5. **Universal Intersection**: Special relationships in universal space

## Advanced Techniques

The `advanced_pattern.py` module adds:

- **Lie Algebra Structure**: sl(2) representation for factor relationships
- **Adelic Analysis**: Multi-prime perspective on factorization  
- **Harmonic Polynomials**: Polynomial representations encoding factors

## Examples

Run the example script to see The Pattern in action:

```bash
python example.py
```

This will demonstrate factorization of various numbers, showing:
- Universal signature extraction
- Mathematical formalization
- Factor decoding
- Universal space relationships

## Theory

The Pattern is based on the principle that composite numbers are not random but follow universal mathematical laws. By recognizing their signature in universal space, we can decode their factors through mathematical operations rather than search.

Key insights:
- Factors have special relationships in universal space (often golden ratio related)
- Resonance fields encode factor information in their peaks and structure
- Universal constants provide the natural basis for expressing these relationships
- The three-stage process (recognize, formalize, execute) is itself universal

## Future Directions

1. **Optimization**: Further optimize resonance field generation
2. **Learning**: Incorporate pattern learning from successful factorizations
3. **Scaling**: Extend to larger numbers through hierarchical application
4. **Generalization**: Apply The Pattern to other mathematical problems
