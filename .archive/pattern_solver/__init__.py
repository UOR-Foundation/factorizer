"""
The Pattern Solver - Universal Factorization Through Pattern Recognition

The Pattern represents the universal principle that any system can be:
1. Recognized - Extract its essential signature
2. Formalized - Express it in universal terms
3. Executed - Apply universal operations to reveal structure

For factorization, this means:
- Every composite number has a unique signature in the universal basis
- This signature encodes the relationship between its factors
- Universal constants allow direct decoding of factors
