# Stream Processor Refactor Task List

## Overview
Refactor The Pattern to use 8-bit stream processing based on empirical tuning. The implementation must handle arbitrary numbers of thousands of bits through scale invariance, not fallbacks.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Analyze test matrix results to identify why performance degrades at 48+ bits
- Examine which methods are being used at different bit ranges
- Identify the transition point where pattern recognition fails
- Document the specific failure modes

### 2. Extract empirical patterns from successful 8-40 bit factorizations
- Analyze byte patterns in successful factorizations
- Map byte values to factor relationships
- Identify consistent patterns across bit ranges

### 3. Create channel behavior analysis tool to discover byte pattern relationships
- Build tool to analyze how each 8-bit channel contributes to factorization
- Discover inter-channel coupling patterns
- Extract the empirical rules that govern factor location

### 4. Build empirical pattern extractor that maps byte patterns to factors
- Create direct mapping from byte sequences to factor pairs
- Identify which bit patterns (0-255) activate which constants
- Build lookup tables from empirical data

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 5. Implement 8-bit stream decomposition for numbers
- Create efficient byte-level decomposition for arbitrary precision numbers
- Ensure proper handling of numbers with thousands of bits
- Maintain alignment with 8-bit channel boundaries

### 6. Create new EmpiricalPattern struct based on discovered patterns
- Replace theoretical Pattern with empirically-driven structure
- Include only fields and methods proven to work
- Ensure scale invariance through proper constant tuning

### 7. Delete non-working methods (phi_sum_guided failures at 48+ bits)
- Remove all methods that show poor performance in tests
- Eliminate search-based approaches
- Keep only pattern recognition methods

### 8. Refactor Pattern to use only empirically proven approaches
- Rebuild pattern module from scratch based on test results
- No theoretical assumptions - only what works in practice
- Ensure constant-time operation through pre-computation

## Low Priority Tasks

### 9. Create tuning loop that continuously improves based on test results
- Automated refinement of channel constants
- Gradient-based optimization of the 8 constants
- Continuous validation against test matrix

### 10. Generate enhanced test matrix with more 48-64 bit cases for tuning
- Focus on the transition region where performance degrades
- Include more edge cases and difficult semiprimes
- Ensure coverage of all byte pattern combinations

## Key Principles
- No fallbacks - pattern recognition either works or fails
- Scale invariance through proper tuning, not algorithms
- Empirical discovery drives implementation
- Refactor continuously based on what works
- The implementation must handle arbitrary bit sizes (thousands of bits)
