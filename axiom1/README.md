# Axiom 1: Prime Ontology

## Foundation
Prime Ontology establishes that all composite numbers exist within a coordinate system defined by prime numbers. Every semiprime has a unique location in prime-space determined by its factors.

## Core Principle
**"Primes are the fundamental particles of number space"**

## Implementation Components

### 1. Prime Core (`prime_core.py`)
- **Primality Testing**: Deterministic Miller-Rabin test
- **Prime Generation**: Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime lists
- **Constants**: SMALL_PRIMES for quick divisibility checks

### 2. Prime Cascade (`prime_cascade.py`)
- **Twin Prime Detection**: p±2 relationships
- **Sophie Germain Chains**: 2p+1 prime sequences
- **Cascading Search**: Following prime relationships through number space

### 3. Prime Geodesic (`prime_geodesic.py`)
- **Prime Coordinates**: n mod p for prime basis vectors
- **Geodesic Walking**: Following paths of maximum prime attraction
- **Pull Calculation**: Gravitational-like attraction to prime divisors

## Mathematical Foundation
- Every number n has prime coordinates: [n mod 2, n mod 3, n mod 5, ...]
- Factors lie at special positions where coordinates align
- Prime geodesics follow paths of steepest descent in prime-space

## Key Algorithms

### Prime Coordinate System
```
coordinate[i] = n mod prime[i]
```

### Geodesic Pull
```
pull(x) = Σ (1/p) for all primes p where coordinate[p] = 0 and x % p = 0
```

## Axiom Compliance
- **NO FALLBACKS**: Pure prime mathematics only
- **NO RANDOMIZATION**: Deterministic prime tests and paths
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION**: Full prime coordinate system
- **NO HARDCODING**: All primes generated mathematically

## Integration with Other Axioms
- Provides prime basis for Axiom 2's Fibonacci flows
- Prime coordinates feed into Axiom 3's spectral analysis
- Prime geodesics guide Axiom 4's observer positions
