# Axiom 5: Self-Reference/Reflection

## Foundation
Self-Reference enables the system to observe its own observation patterns, creating a meta-level of understanding that transcends the individual axioms. This recursive reflection allows the system to identify blind spots, generate emergent methods, and adapt to previously unsolvable cases.

## Core Principle
**"The observer observes itself, creating recursive coherence that reveals hidden patterns"**

## Implementation Components

### 1. Meta-Observer (`meta_observer.py`)
- **Observation of Observers**: Track patterns across all axiom applications
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify which axioms work for which number types
- **Blind Spot Detection**: Find patterns that consistently fail
- **Meta-Coherence Fields**: Coherence of coherence patterns

### 2. Spectral Mirror (`spectral_mirror.py`)
- **Self-Reflection**: Use n's spectrum to modulate search strategies
- **Mirror Points**: Find factors at spectral reflection positions
- **Inverse Spectral Mapping**: Map from spectrum space back to factor space
- **Recursive Mirroring**: Apply mirroring to mirrored patterns

### 3. Axiom Synthesis (`axiom_synthesis.py`)
- **Pattern Fusion**: Combine successful patterns from different axioms
- **Hybrid Methods**: Create new detection methods from axiom combinations
- **Emergent Algorithms**: Let patterns generate new patterns
- **Cross-Axiom Resonance**: Find where axioms reinforce each other

### 4. Recursive Coherence (`recursive_coherence.py`)
- **Meta-Coherence**: Apply coherence to coherence fields
- **Fractal Patterns**: Self-similar structures at multiple scales
- **Golden Ratio Recursion**: Recursive depth based on φ
- **Coherence Attractors**: Fixed points in coherence space

### 5. Failure Analysis (`failure_analysis.py`)
- **Failure Memory**: Track what doesn't work and why
- **Pattern Anti-Learning**: Learn to avoid dead ends
- **Spectral Null Detection**: Identify coherence valleys
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Modify approach based on failure patterns

## Mathematical Foundation
- Meta-coherence: MC(C) = coherence applied to coherence field C
- Spectral mirror: M(x) = n - spectral_distance(x, n/x)
- Axiom synthesis: H = α₁A₁ + α₂A₂ + ... where αᵢ are learned weights
- Recursive depth: d = ⌊log_φ(n)⌋ levels of self-reference

## Key Algorithms

### Meta-Observer Pattern
```
for each factorization attempt:
    track which axioms were used
    measure their effectiveness
    identify failure points
    generate meta-coherence map
```

### Spectral Mirror Generation
```
mirror_point(x) = argmin_y |S(x) + S(y) - S(n)|
reflection = n × S(n) / S(x)  (in spectral space)
```

### Axiom Synthesis
```
success_patterns = analyze_past_successes()
failure_patterns = analyze_past_failures()
new_method = combine(success_patterns) - avoid(failure_patterns)
```

### Recursive Coherence
```
C₀ = initial_coherence_field
Cᵢ₊₁ = coherence(Cᵢ, Cᵢ, target_pattern)
fixed_point = lim(Cᵢ) as i → ∞
```

## Axiom Compliance
- **NO FALLBACKS**: Pure self-referential mathematics
- **NO RANDOMIZATION**: Deterministic meta-observation
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION**: Full recursive implementation
- **NO HARDCODING**: All meta-patterns emerge naturally

## Integration with Other Axioms
- Observes all other axioms' performance (meta-level)
- Creates hybrid methods from axiom combinations
- Uses recursive coherence on Axiom 3's fields
- Applies golden ratio recursion from Axiom 2
- Generates new prime patterns beyond Axiom 1

## Special Properties
- **Emergence**: New factorization methods arise from self-observation
- **Adaptation**: System learns from both successes and failures
- **Transcendence**: Goes beyond individual axiom limitations
- **Completeness**: Self-reference closes the axiom loop
